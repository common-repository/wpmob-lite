== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the best size for the logo and banner customization? =

The exact size of the current logo is 169 x 70 px and the banner is 320 x 67 px . You can easily customize this logo and banner through the WPmob Lite panel, just simply put the url of your own logo and banner.

= I thought the iPhone/iPod touch/Pre/Storm/Android shows my website fine the way it is now? =

Yes, that's true for the most part. However, not all websites are created equal, with some sites failing to translate well in the viewport of a small mobile device. Many WordPress sites today make heavy use of different javascript files which significantly increase the load time of pages, and drive your visitors on 3G/EDGE batty. So we've come up with *WPmob Lite*, a lightweight, fast-loading, feature-rich and highly-customized "theme application" which includes an admin interface to let you customize many aspects of your site's presentation.

= Well, what if my users don't like it and want to see my regular site? =

There's a mobile switch option in the footer on *WPmob Lite* for your users with browsers that support cookies to easily switch between the *WPmob Lite* view and your site's regular appearance. It's that easy. We even automatically put a little snippet of code into your current theme which will be shown only to iPhone, iPod touch, Android or BlackBerry touch mobile device visitors, giving them control to switch between the two site themes easily.

= Will it slow down my blog, or increase my server load? =

Not bloody likely! Unless of course you're getting slammed with all sorts of traffic because you've installed this sexy plugin. The entire theme files footprint for *WPmob Lite* is small. It was designed to be as lightweight and speedy as possible, while still serving your site's content in a richly presented way, sparing no essential features like search, login, categories, tags, comments etc.
